*
*  The DICOM  Attribute tags consist of a 4 byte group and a 4 byte element in hexadecimal notation
* Other properties are the VR value representation.  For implicit transfer syntaxes
* the VR is obtained from the dicom dictionary.  For explicit transfer syntaxes, the VR will be defined in the
* file/data.  The string valeu is the human readable definition of the tag.
