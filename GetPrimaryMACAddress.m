    File:			GetPrimaryMACAddress.c
	
    Description:	This sample application demonstrates how to do retrieve the Ethernet MAC
					address of the built-in Ethernet interface from the I/O Registry on Mac OS X.
					Techniques shown include finding the primary (built-in) Ethernet interface,
					finding the parent Ethernet controller, and retrieving properties from the
					controller's I/O Registry entry.
