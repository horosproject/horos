/**
 * The runtime sends initialize to each class in a program exactly one time just before the class,
 * or any class that inherits from it, is sent its first message from within the program. (Thus the
 * method may never be invoked if the class is not used.) The runtime sends the initialize message to
 * classes in a thread-safe manner. Superclasses receive this message before their subclasses.
 *
 * This method may also be called directly (assumably by accident), hence the safety mechanism.

// A quick overview of how this class works:
// 
// The HTTPConnection will request data from us via the readDataOfLength method.
// The first time this method is called, we won't have any data available.
// So we'll start a background operation to read data from the file, and then return nil.
// The HTTPConnection, upon receiving a nil response, will then wait for us to inform it of available data.
// 
// Once the background read operation completes, the fileHandleDidReadData method will be called.
// We then inform the HTTPConnection that we have the requested data by
// calling HTTPConnection's responseHasAvailableData.
// The HTTPConnection will then request our data via the readDataOfLength method.
