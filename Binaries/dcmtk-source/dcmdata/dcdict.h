/*
** CVS/RCS Log:
** $Log: dcdict.h,v $
** Revision 1.1  2006/03/01 20:15:21  lpysher
** Added dcmtkt ocvs not in xcode  and fixed bug with multiple monitors
**
** Revision 1.20  2005/12/08 16:28:09  meichel
** Changed include path schema for all DCMTK header files
**
** Revision 1.19  2004/01/16 14:07:27  joergr
** Removed acknowledgements with e-mail addresses from CVS log.
**
** Revision 1.18  2002/07/23 14:21:25  meichel
** Added support for private tag data dictionaries to dcmdata
**
** Revision 1.17  2002/02/27 14:21:20  meichel
** Declare dcmdata read/write locks only when compiled in multi-thread mode
**
** Revision 1.16  2001/06/01 15:48:38  meichel
** Updated copyright header
**
** Revision 1.15  2000/05/03 14:19:08  meichel
** Added new class GlobalDcmDataDictionary which implements read/write lock
**   semantics for safe access to the DICOM dictionary from multiple threads
**   in parallel. The global dcmDataDict now uses this class.
**
** Revision 1.14  2000/03/08 16:26:13  meichel
** Updated copyright header.
**
** Revision 1.13  1999/03/31 09:24:35  meichel
** Updated copyright header in module dcmdata
**
** Revision 1.12  1998/07/15 15:48:45  joergr
** Removed several compiler warnings reported by gcc 2.8.1 with
** additional options, e.g. missing copy constructors and assignment
** operators, initialization of member variables in the body of a
** constructor instead of the member initialization list, hiding of
** methods by use of identical names, uninitialized member variables,
** missing const declaration of char pointers. Replaced tabs by spaces.
**
** Revision 1.11  1997/08/26 14:02:56  hewett
** New data structures for data-dictionary.  The main part of the
** data-dictionary is now stored in an hash table using an optimized
** hash function.  This new data structure reduces data-dictionary
** load times by a factor of 4!  he data-dictionary specific linked-list
** has been replaced by a linked list derived from OFList class
** (see ofstd/include/oflist.h).
** The only interface modifications are related to iterating over the entire
** data dictionary which should not be needed by "normal" applications.
**
** Revision 1.10  1997/07/21 08:25:07  andreas
** - Replace all boolean types (BOOLEAN, CTNBOOLEAN, DICOM_BOOL, BOOL)
**   with one unique boolean type OFBool.
**
** Revision 1.9  1997/05/22 13:15:54  hewett
** Added method DcmDataDictionary::isDictionaryLoaded() to ask if a full
** data dictionary has been loaded.  This method should be used in tests
** rather that querying the number of entries (a sekelton dictionary is
** now always present).
**
** Revision 1.8  1997/05/13 13:58:41  hewett
** Added member function (loadSkeletomDictionary) to preload of a few
** essential attribute descriptions into the data dictionary (e.g. Item
** and ItemDelimitation tags).
**
** Revision 1.7  1996/09/18 16:37:10  hewett
** Added capability to search data dictionary by tag name.
**
** Revision 1.6  1996/03/22 13:09:12  hewett
** Moved the definition of DCM_DICT_DEFAULT_PATH to the system
** dependent configuration files included via "osconfig.h".
**
** Revision 1.5  1996/03/21 09:50:38  hewett
** Added a  method numberOfEntries() to return the total number of
** dictionary entries.
**
** Revision 1.4  1996/03/20 16:43:49  hewett
** Updated for revised data dictionary.  Repeating tags are now handled better.
** A linear list of repeating tags has been introduced with a subset ordering
** mechanism to ensure that dictionary searches locate the most precise
** dictionary entry.
