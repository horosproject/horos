/** \class SymmetricEigenAnalysis
 * \brief Find Eigen values of a real 2D symmetric matrix. It
 * serves as a thread-safe alternative to the class:
 * vnl_symmetric_eigensystem, which uses netlib routines.
 *
 * The class is templated over the input matrix (which is expected to provide
 * access to its elements with the [][] operator), matrix to store eigen
 * values (must provide write operations on its elements with the [] operator), and
 * EigenMatrix to store eigen vectors (must provide write access to its elements
 * with the [][] operator).
 *
 * The SetOrderEigenValues() method can be used to order eigen values (and their
 * corresponding eigen vectors if computed) in ascending order. This is the
 * default ordering scheme. Eigen vectors and values can be obtained without
 * ordering by calling SetOrderEigenValues(false).
 *
 * The SetOrderEigenMagnitudes() method can be used to order eigen values (and
 * their corresponding eigen vectors if computed) by magnitude in ascending order.
 *
 * The user of this class is explicitly supposed to set the dimension of the
 * 2D matrix using the SetDimension() method.
 *
 * The class contains routines taken from netlib sources (www.netlib.org).
